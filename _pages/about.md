I am an Associate Professor at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg). My interests include research in systems and system security, the social and economics aspects of cyber security, and education. 

I'm advising the [Curiosity Reserach Group](https://curiosity.comp.nus.edu.sg) with the following missions:
* Understand systems (理解系统),
* Abstract knowledge (提炼知识),
* Connect facts (参悟规律).

The ethos of our group: Be interesting people, do meaningful work.

I'm also the co-lead Principal Investigator of [National Cybersecurity R&D Laboratory (NCL)](https://ncl.sg) of Singapore.

We are looking for curious minds to join our exploration. If you share the same passion, please do not hesitate to reach me. Curiosity is required, while skill and mentality for repairing things (such as bicycles) is a plus. Positions are available at all levels, from undergraduate researcher/interns, Master/Ph.D. students, and postdoc research fellows.
