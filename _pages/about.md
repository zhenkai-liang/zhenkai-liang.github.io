I am an Associate Professor at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg). My interests include research in systems and system security, the social aspects of cyber security, and education. I'm advising the [Curiosity Reserach Group](https://curiosity.comp.nus.edu.sg) with the following missions:

Understanding systems (理解系统), abstracting knowledge (提炼知识), and connecting facts (参悟规律).

We are looking for curious minds to join our exploration. If you share the same view of the world, please do not hesitate to reach me. Curiosity is required, while mentality for repairing things (such as bicycles) is a plus. Positions are available at all levels, from undergraduate researcher/interns, Ph.D. students, and postdoc research fellows.
