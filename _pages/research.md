My core research interest includes computer systems and system security, including program analysis, system provenance analysis, cyber security experimentation and analysis, trusted execution environments, security of AI and other emerging systems. 

I have also started new research explorations in security-related topics beyond computer systems: economics/finance/policy aspects of cyber security, such as prevention of online scam, financial modeling of cyber crime, and cyber insurance.  

Research Directions
===================

### System security and cyber experimentation analysis 
* Kernel mechanisms for confidential computing
* System provence mechanisms and analysis techniques
* Cyber experimentation as code

### Software security and malicious application analysis
* Vulnerability discovery and analysis
* Binary analysis and protection
* Mobile malware analysis

### AI security from system principles
* Application of AI and recommendation system in software and system security
* LLM security analysis using software security techniques
* Agent system analysis and security

### Beyond security and systems
* Online scam prevention
* Financial modeling of cyber crime and cyber incidents
* Cyber insurance and cyber risk analysis
