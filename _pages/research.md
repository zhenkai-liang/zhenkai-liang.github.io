My core research interest includes computer systems and system security, including program analysis, system provenance analysis, cyber security experimentation and analysis, trusted execution environments, security of AI and other emerging systems. I have also started new research explorations in security-related topics beyond computer systems: economics/finance/policy aspects of cyber security, such as prevention of online scam, financial modeling of cyber crime, and cyber insurance.
